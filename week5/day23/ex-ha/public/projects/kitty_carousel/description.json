        "A Web-based slideshow is a slide show which can be played (viewed or presented) using a web browser. Some web based slide shows are generated from presentation software and may be difficult to change (usually unintentionally so). Others offer templates allowing the slide show to be easily edited and changed. Compared to a fully fledged presentation program the web based slide shows are usually limited in features."
